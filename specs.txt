Project B

Objective:

Build a simple command-line To-Do list application where users can add, remove, view, and mark tasks completed.

Features:

View tasks: Users should be able to see a list of their tasks, each with a status indicating whether it is pending or completed.

Add Tasks: Users should be able to add new tasks to their list.

Remove tasks: Users should have the option to remove tasks from the list

Mark Tasks as Completed

Hints:

Think about what data structure will be most useful in this application to hold your tasks.
Implement functions for each feature: viewing tasks, adding new tasks, removing tasks, and marking tasks as completed.
Create a loop that keeps the program running and displays a menu of options for the user to choose from (view, add, remove, complete a task, and exit)

Improvements:

Implement error handling to manage user inputs
Allow for task editing
Sort tasks by status or creation date
Implement categories or tags for tasks
Focus on getting the basic functionality working before moving to more advanced features. The takeaway from this project is to practice manipulating 
lists and dictionaries, working with loops, and handling user input in Python
